Description: Connectome Mapper implements a full diffusion MRI processing pipeline.
 Connectome Mapper implements a full diffusion MRI processing pipeline, from raw Diffusion/T1/T2 data to multi-resolution connection matrices. It also offers support for resting state fMRI data processing and multi-resolution functional connection matrices creation. The Connectome Mapper is part of the Connectome Mapping Toolkit.
